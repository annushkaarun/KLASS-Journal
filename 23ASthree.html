            <p>
            C is for the COVID-19 crisis that ran its course  <br>
            Starting with its conquest of China<br>
            Where this new coronavirus chose it's first epicentre<br>
            And commenced what would become<br>
            A worldwide catastrophe.<br>
            </p>
            <p>

            C is for the curiosity<br>
            That came before the interest<br>
            In the new and complex concepts<br>
            Of Chemistry and Combined Add Maths<br>
            Of concentration and of Calculus<br>
            In our IGCSE courses<br>
            That carried on through the lockdown.<br>
            </p>
            <p>

            C is for the courage<br>
            That it took to face the constant changes<br>
            From incomplete coursework<br>
            To proof of concept models,<br>
            The creativity that continued<br>
            To flow through the collaboration<br>
            In hangout chats and comments<br>
            That kept us connected.<br>
            </p>

            <p>

            C is for the confusion<br>
            Of school closures and classroom calls<br>
            And the challenges<br>
            Of craning our necks to peer into the camera<br>
            At classmates across the cyberspace,<br>
            Confined to their separate corners of the country<br>
            Due to the movement control orders<br>
            That have changed the way we coexist.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            C is for the comfort<br>
            Of the novel concept of learning from home,<br>
            Staying cozy in bed<br>
            With no need to catch the bus,<br>
            Striking casual conversations<br>
            With siblings during class,<br>
            No commuting between periods<br>
            Meant a more carefree routine<br>
            Eating chocolate and crisps<br>
            Behind the icons covering our screens.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            C is for the choices<br>
            That will create opportunity in the future<br>
            To overcome what little control we have<br>
            Over our current lives<br>
            And continue to consider our pathways<br>
            For life beyond the constriction.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            C is for the commitment<br>
            To coaching us through a pandemic<br>
            With online concert recordings for Christmas<br>
            And with coding competitions and crossfit circuits<br>
            To keep us cheerful and in check<br>
            For when life can continue as normal.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            C is for the consolation<br>
            From our compassionate and considerate teachers<br>
            For overcoming the cancellations of exams,<br>
            For combatting the desire<br>
            To completely abandon all hopes and plans<br>
            Of attaining the flying colours<br>
            That we are all capable of achieving,<br>
            For the confidence they gave us<br>
            To carry on chasing our dreams.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            C is for the comrades<br>
            Who carried us through the conflict<br>
            Who cared for us in lockdown<br>
            And comforted us in solitude,<br>
            For the compassion that they showed<br>
            That brought us ever closer,<br>
            Constructed bonds that we will cherish<br>
            And created courage<br>
            Within our character.<br>
            </p>

            C is for the the care that we take,<br>
            The connections we make,<br>
            The cynical cycles we break,<br>
            The cruel agony of the ache,<br>
            For the changes that take shape,<br>
            The lines that converge to one place,<br>
            The collective experiences that we share,<br>
            The ways we show each other that we care,<br>
            For striving to make a contrasting world fair,<br>
            For equal opportunity regardless of the colour of our hair,<br>
            For the company of our friends that helps us to bear<br>
            The challenges of a situation that threatens to tear<br>
            A crevice through the life of every man,<br>
            A time in our lives that has shown us we can<br>
            Clutch on to the edge of the crater that swallowed our plans<br>
            And though we are crumbling we still hold it together<br>
            And still find a way to stay close to each other.<br>
            In conclusion we find ourselves nearing the end of another<br>
            School year that must be cherished before it is over.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            And that is why, fellow companions,<br>
            C is a very significant letter to me.<br>
            </p>
